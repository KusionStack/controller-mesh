# Kridge

Kridge is a solution that helps developers manage their controllers/operators better.

The design architecture of this project is based on [openkruise/controllermesh](https://github.com/openkruise/controllermesh).

## Key Features

1. **Sharding**: Through relevant configurations, Kubernetes single-point deployed operator applications can be flexibly shard deployed.
2. **Canary upgrade**: Depends on sharding, the controllers can be updated in canary progress instead of one time replace.
3. **Circuit breaker and rate limiter**: Not only Kubernetes operation requests, but also other external operation requests.
4. **Multicluster routing and sharding**: This feature is supported by [kusionstack/kaera(karbour)]()

## Quick Start
Visit [Quick Start]().


## Installation
**Install by helm** (TODO)
```shell
# Firstly add charts repository if you haven't do this.
$ helm repo add kusionstack https://kusionstack.github.io/charts/

# [Optional]
$ helm repo update

# Install the latest version.
$ helm install kridge kusionstack/kridge --version 0.0.x

# Uninstall
$ helm uninstall kridge
```
**Proxy**  
1. Apply your [ShardingConfig]().
2. Add label `kridge.kusionstack.io/enable-proxy=true` on pod template.


## Principles

Generally, a `kridge-proxy` container will be injected into each operator Pod that has configured in Kridge.
This proxy container will intercept and handle the connection by between API/Oth Server and controllers/webhooks in the Pod.

ApiServer proxy method:
- *iptables nat*: 
- *fake kubeconfig*: 

The `kridge-manager` dispatches rules to the proxies, so that they can route requests according to the rules.


A core CRD in Kridge is `ShardingConfig`. It contains all rules for user's controller:

```yaml
apiVersion: kridge.kusionstack.io/v1alpha1
kind: ShardingConfig
metadata:
  name: sharding-demo
  namespace: operator-demo
spec:
  controller:
    leaderElectionName: operator-leader
  webhook:
    certDir: /tmp/webhook-certs
    port: 9443
  limits:
    - objectSelector:
        relateResources:
          - apiGroups:
              - '*'
            resources:
              - pods
              - services
        selector:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: kridge.kusionstack.io/namespace
              operator: In
              values:
                - ns-a
                - ns-b
          matchLabels:
          # ...
  selector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-name
        operator: In
        values:
          - operator-demo-0
```

- selector: for all pods under a shard. It can be a subset of pods under a StatefulSet.
- controller: configuration for controller, including leader election name
- webhook: configuration for webhook, including certDir and port of this webhook
- limits: shard isolation is achieved through a set of `ObjectSelector`.

When `manager` is first launched, shard labels will be added to all configured resources.

- `kridge.kusionstack.io/sharding-hash`: the hash value calculated based on the namespace ranges from 0 to 31.
- `kridge.kusionstack.io/namespace`: the namespace referring to this resource.
- `kridge.kusionstack.io/control`: under kridge control.


In this repo, Kridge only support `ObjectSelector` type of flow control,
which means the `kridge-proxy `will proxy list&watch requests to the ApiServer, 
and inject a `LabelSelector` into the request param for the requested resource type.
