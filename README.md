# Sample Operator

This operator is generated by [operator-sdk](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/installation/), and some simple working logic is added on this basis.


```shell
cd sample

# Generate a sample operator
operator-sdk init --domain example.kusionstack.io --repo github.com/kusionstack/example

# Add some simple work logic

```
